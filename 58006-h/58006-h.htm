<i>&amp;c.</i> <i>&amp;c.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> most adorable Redeemer is set
forth in the sacred Scriptures, as the glorious Mediator of a
better Testament.&nbsp; In this character, he sustains the
three-fold office in his Church, of Prophet, Priest, and
King&mdash;from everlasting he was set up to be future
man&mdash;to ransom the elect, honor the divine Law, and glorify
all the sublime Attributes of God.&nbsp; As Man-Mediator he was
set up; for as the eternal Jehovah, he could not be higher than
he was; God having chosen his elect in him, accepted them in
him&mdash;he appointed him to be <i>all</i> to them; do all for
them; and finally bring them to glory&mdash;hence, he says,
<i>Thy throne</i>, <i>O God</i>, <i>is for ever &amp;
ever</i>.&nbsp; The Lord Jesus having engaged in the eternal
Covenant, to be our Surety, Righteousness, Advocate, and Friend,
immediately after the breach of the Covenant of Works, he
graciously <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>revealed himself in his lovely offices; and, as a
Prophet, he foretold his own incarnation, threatened Satan, and
pardoned our first Parents.&nbsp; As a Prophet, he preached by
the ministry of Noah, to those souls now in the prison of
hell&mdash;was typified by all the pious prophets that appeared
till his coming in the flesh, when he gave ocular demonstration
that he was that Prophet that should come into the world&mdash;he
carries on, and still executes this office in the hearts of his
people, by his Word and Spirit&mdash;enlightening their minds,
and leading them into all truth; removing the veil of ignorance,
and delivering his people from all damnable heresies&mdash;hence
he says, <i>I am the Lord thy God</i>, <i>which teacheth thee to
profit</i>, <i>and leadeth thee in the way in which thou
shouldest go</i>&mdash;this is done by the holy Spirit&rsquo;s
inhabitation.&nbsp; As our Prophet, he is our light, and will be
so for ever&mdash;<i>for the Lord shall be thy everlasting
light</i>, <i>&amp; thy God thy glory</i>&mdash;though this
office will be carried on in heaven different to what it is on
earth.&nbsp; His character, as Mediator, includes his Priestly
Office; and this is of vast importance to us&mdash;this was
shadowed forth under the old Law, by the calling and
qualification of the High Priests, particularly Aaron, though
Christ was not of the same tribe with him, nor made a Priest
after that Law, but of one more ancient, and which continues to
this day, and will for ever, <i>after the order of
Melchisedec</i>&mdash;ever blessing his people, and his blessing
on Mount Zion is life for evermore.&nbsp; <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Yet Aaron was a
figure of the High Priest of our Profession, in his separation
from his brethren; in the holy unction, when installed into
office; in the several vestments with which he was cloathed; his
mitre, embroidered coat, ephod, and the girdle of it; with the
breast-plate of Judgment&mdash;but more so in the sacrifices he
offered up; all which held forth the Redeemer, who, through the
eternal Spirit, offered up himself to God; being himself the
Altar, Priest, and Sacrifice.&nbsp; He is still carrying on this
office in the Church, and for his people, by presenting his
sacred Person, and meritorious Work, to the Father; making
intercession, not as he did on earth, <i>with strong cries and
tears to God</i>&mdash;not as supplicating an angry Judge; but by
shewing himself, as having done, as our Surety, all that Law and
Justice could require&mdash;he is now our Advocate on high,
offering up our prayers and praises, which become acceptable to
God, through the sweet incense of his Mediation.&nbsp; Our
spiritual holiness is derived from him as our Priest.&nbsp; We
are anointed by virtue of union with him&mdash;the same divine
anointing that was on him, as the Head, runs down, even to the
skirts of his cloathing, on the meanest, lowest, and weakest of
his saints; and it is the business of our faith to make use of
him in every season of guilt and bondage.&nbsp; We feel the
liberty of God&rsquo;s children, as we are led by the Spirit to
Jesus, as our atoning and interceding Priest, putting away sin;
whilst the Spirit bears testimony <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>to the conscience, <i>that the blood
of Christ cleaneth from all sin</i>.</p>
<p>Another office of vast importance to the Church of God, is the
Kingly Authority of our Redeemer; this he sustains, and this he
exercises&mdash;as God he is King by nature, and has a kingdom,
common to the three divine Persons&mdash;hence he is called Lord
of Hosts, or armies; the six armies&mdash;two in heaven, elect
angels and spirits of just men&mdash;two on earth, the Church and
the nations of the world&mdash;two in hell, fallen angels and
reprobate characters; and it is a most awful consideration, that
all who despise his Law, Gospel, and Grace, dying in such a
state, he will make them feel his kingly power, in <i>breaking
them to pieces</i>.&mdash;Psalm ii.&nbsp; This office is
exercised in the Church of God; the Father himself says, <i>Yet
have I set my King upon my holy hill of Zion</i>: the learned
tell us it reads in the Hebrew, I have <i>anointed</i> my King
upon my holy hill of Zion&mdash;in allusion to their anointing
kings at their inauguration&mdash;<i>anointed with the oil of
gladness</i>, <i>above their fellows</i>.&mdash;In the Old
Testament he was prophesied of and typified by pious
kings.&mdash;The Church of God is Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, and the
members of it his subjects: the exercise of this office is first
in the hearts of his saints, in rescuing them from the power of
the Devil, by his almighty grace&mdash;the King of Glory opens
the doors of their hearts; first destroys the Devil&rsquo;s
armour, even the <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>veil of ignorance, (in which he trusts) then turns Satan
out for ever.&nbsp; <i>He makes us willing in the day of his
power</i>, to come out of the world; to chuse him as our
<i>better part</i>; to love him, to serve him all our days, <i>in
the newness of the Spirit</i>, <i>and not in the oldness of the
Letter</i>&mdash;the throne he sits on is our hearts, and this
will be for ever&mdash;<i>thy throne</i>, <i>O God</i>, <i>is for
ever and ever</i>.&nbsp; He displays this office in our defence;
<i>for upon all the glory shall be a defence from our
enemies</i>; from the dominion and damning power of sin;
maintaining our graces, continuing and preserving us in the
faith, keeps us from falling, finally, and preserves us to his
heavenly kingdom and glory.&mdash;This office is executed,
externally, by the Word and Ordinances.&nbsp; Christ, as King, is
Law-Giver in his own Church; the New Testament is our Rule of
Conduct.&nbsp; As Ministers, we are not to send our hearers, nor
go ourselves to Moses, for a Rule of Conduct; the preceptive
parts of the New Testament are quite sufficient; and where their
is faith in the soul, embracing the righteousness of Jesus, and
the love of God shed abroad in the heart, such are no
Antinomians; for the righteousness of the holy and righteous Law
of God, is fulfilled in them <i>who walk not after the flesh</i>,
<i>but after the Spirit</i>&mdash;this is the end of the Law, and
the glory of the Gospel; and while we serve <i>in the newness of
the Spirit</i>, we obey the external Precepts of the Law, as far
as they extend to us, as creatures of God&rsquo;s power.&nbsp; <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>We have no
spiritual King but Jesus; he is the Head of the Church, and the
Master of his House.&nbsp; His laws are spiritual, as they relate
to spiritual Subjects&mdash;<i>I will put my laws in their
hearts</i>, <i>and in their minds will I write them</i>.&nbsp;
These are, first, Faith, which is the Work of the Holy Ghost, and
centers in the Person and Work of Jesus.&nbsp; The other is
Love&mdash;<i>a new commandment I give unto you</i>, <i>that ye
love one another</i>.&nbsp; This love stands distinguished from
that mentioned in the old Covenant; <i>that</i> respects all
mankind, as our fellow creatures&mdash;<i>this</i> is the law of
Love; a new commandment Christ has given to us.&nbsp; As King he
has external Laws, which must be obeyed in Faith and Love, called
the Obedience of Faith, and <i>serving in the newness of the
Spirit</i>; and I am very confident that wherever Christ has
displayed his Prophetic office in teaching, and his Priestly
office in anointing the soul, that all such characters accept
Christ as their King, and say, from the heart, <i>Thine are
we</i>, <i>Lord</i>, <i>and on thy side</i>, <i>thou blessed King
Zion</i>&mdash;<i>O King</i>, <i>live for ever</i>! <i>and take
me as I am</i>&mdash;<i>to thee I yield till my powers</i>,
<i>and consecrate all my days</i>.</p>
<p>I remark, then, that there are certain external Laws, which
Jesus has issued out, and ought to be attended to; not one of
them is grievous; <i>but this yoke is easy</i>, <i>and this
burden is light</i>.&nbsp; His commandments or ordinances are not
grievous, but <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>pleasant; and when our Faith is in exercise, our Hope
lively, and our Love glowing, we find <i>Wisdom&rsquo;s ways
pleasantness</i>, <i>and all her paths peace</i>.&nbsp; I will
mention some, and enlarge only upon one, which is the design of
this Discourse.</p>
<p><i>First</i>&mdash;The <span class="smcap">Ministry</span> of
the <span class="smcap">Word</span>.&nbsp; This is the glorious
<i>Magna Charta</i>, exhibiting the loveliness of the Saviour,
the wisdom of God, the freeness of grace, the high privileges of
all the elect.&nbsp; I mention this because some proud professors
have written (and many have imbibed their error) <i>that every
Christian is to be a Preacher</i>!&mdash;and if so, Where would
be the <i>Hearers</i>?&nbsp; These men, to me, resemble the awful
characters that conspired against Moses and Aaron, who said,
<i>all the Lord&rsquo;s people are holy</i>; and why should not
one be exalted to preach as well as another!&nbsp; But let the
above characters read their awful end, as recorded in the 16th
Chapter of <i>Numbers</i>.&nbsp; The public Ministry of the Word
is an Ordinance of Christ, for public good; this is plain from
the Old and New Testament&mdash;<i>See</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>that
ye refuse not him that speaketh from heaven in Christ&rsquo;s
name</i>; <i>for how can they preach</i>, to any good purpose,
<i>except they be sent</i>?</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Prayer</span>,
public and private; and good men ought always to pray&mdash;<i>I
will that men pray every where</i>&mdash;the Jews had their
stated times for Prayer; <i>in the evening</i>, <i>in the
morning</i>, <i>and at </i><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span><i>noon-day will I cry unto
thee</i>.&nbsp; In public, by Ministers, or private Christians at
their Prayer-Meetings, which are praise-worthy, when carried on
in a spirit of modesty and humility, with life and
fervor&mdash;and here I would drop a Word of
Exhortation&mdash;Let your public Prayers be always short.&nbsp;
O that Ministers, Masters, Heads of Families, and those who
conduct Prayer-Meetings, would adopt this method.&nbsp; God
forbid that I should limit the Holy One of Israel to time, in
leading the minds of his people to himself, but we can certainly
distinguish between access to God, and a long, dry, formal
address to the Deity.&nbsp; How tedious the service when the
Minister is nearly half an hour (and I have known it the case
forty minutes) in Prayer, and the same old, dry, formal address
to God twice, and perhaps three times a day.&nbsp; O that
Dissenters, Baptists, and Presbyterians particularly, were
convinced how painful they render that service that ought to be
perfect freedom, to old and young.&nbsp; The same hint I would
drop to those who conduct Prayer-Meetings: Why should one brother
be so prolix as to engage a full half hour, and sometimes more,
wounding the feelings of others that ought to be engaged, and
rendering the whole service tedious.&nbsp; Perhaps this is one
reason why our Prayer Meetings are so often neglected&mdash;no
brother ought to occupy more than one quarter of an hour,
including the hymn, so that four might engage in one hour; and if
there are not brethren enough to carry <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>it on, then I recommend the
Scriptures to be read, and singing of Hymns.&nbsp; Permit me,
also to advise the Heads of private families, where there are
servants kept, and young people, children, and the various
branches of that family, to use brevity in your Prayers; your
servants, perhaps, have been hard at work all day&mdash;they are
tired and heavy: O what a burden they must consider Religion when
you keep them on their knees full half an hour; and I have known
it too often forty-five minutes!&nbsp; This renders the externals
of Religion an unpleasant service to those of your family who
know not God.&nbsp; Contrive to make your evening services short;
and if circumstances would admit, it would be well if this were
performed before supper, before your and their powers are almost
lost in sleep, or at least heaviness.&mdash;Try to make the very
externals of Religion pleasant&mdash;Let your Prayers be grave,
solid, and important; avoid nonsense, absurdities, loud speaking,
or too low to be heard; above all, avoid levelling your speeches
in Prayer, at individuals present; why should any one make a
throne of grace a bow to discharge arrows at others.&nbsp; I have
mentioned those things, as they have long hurt my mind; I hope it
will prove a word in season, while none will take offence at my
design, as I have no other end in view than the honor of
Religion.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Godly
Conversation</span> must be considered an Ordinance.&nbsp; This
must be carried on <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>with humility of course; affection, kindness, and
tenderness, to those of different denominations from ourselves;
while the main subject ought to be, the way the Lord has led us;
the great things he has done for us; what ideas God has been
pleased to give us of Jesus, his blood and obedience; his
Covenant; what light to understand such a sweet text; how he
applied such a Sermon, such an hymn, such a promise; how wrought
such a deliverance; appeared in such an hour of temptation.&nbsp;
These topics would encourage one another, comfort the
feeble-minded, exalt the Saviour, and exclude scandal, wrath,
bitterness, and a party spirit.&mdash;<i>Come hither</i>, <i>all
ye that fear God</i>, <i>I will tell you what he has done for my
soul</i>.&mdash;<i>They shall speak of the glory of thy
kingdom</i>.&mdash;<i>They that feared the Lord</i>, <i>spake
often one to another</i>, remembering the end of their
Conversation, <i>Jesus Christ</i>, <i>the same yesterday</i>,
<i>to-day</i>, <i>and for ever</i>!</p>
<p><i>Fourthly</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Singing</span> his
high Praises, with the understanding, and with grace in the
heart.&nbsp; This is an Ordinance kept up in all ages of the
Church: <i>Is any merry</i>, <i>let him sing Psalms</i>.&mdash;So
another is, <i>Speaking to yourselves in Psalms and Hymns</i>,
<i>and spiritual Songs</i>; <i>singing with grace in the heart to
the Lord Jesus</i>.&nbsp; This Ordinance is not a carnal one, nor
is it to be despised: the Quakers, and some other characters I
have met with, set it aside as a carnal Ordinance.&nbsp; O! what
an awful <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>insult upon the Saviour! who, with his disciples,
<i>sung an Hymn</i>, <i>and then went out to the Mount of
Olives</i>.&nbsp; What an insult to set aside this Ordinance as
carnal, seeing the Holy Ghost by the Apostles Paul and James, has
commanded it; and John heard the Songs of the redeemed, in the
Church militant&mdash;and of Saints it is said, <i>Let the high
Praises of God be in their mouths</i>.&nbsp; Singing is only
speaking in a musical voice; and the subject-matter of it ought
to be the precious Person of Immanuel; every Hymn ought to be of
him and to him&mdash;this enlivens worship; God delights to hear
it, and those characters that set it aside altogether, I am
almost uncharitable enough to suppose they have nothing to sing
about.&nbsp; But if we have obtained Mercy, Righteousness,
Redemption, and Pardon, let us sing of them&mdash;<i>I will sing
of Mercy &amp; Judgement</i>&mdash;<i>I will sing of thy
Righteousness all the day</i>.&nbsp; <i>They sung a new Song</i>,
<i>saying</i>, <i>Worthy the Lamb that redeemed us</i>.</p>
<p><i>Fifthly</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Baptism</span> is
another Ordinance: this is evident from the commandment of our
Lord to his Apostles: <i>Go teach all nations</i>; <i>baptizing
them in the name of the Three divine Persons</i>.&nbsp; Some
learned men that have written against this Ordinance, tell us it
is the Baptism of the Holy Ghost; and that the Greek text reads,
<i>into the name</i>&mdash;and suppose it does, this is no
argument against Water Baptism&mdash;the Apostles were never
commanded to <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>baptize any one with the Holy Ghost, that was the
immediate Work of the Spirit himself.&nbsp; Besides, there is a
vast difference between baptizing into the <i>Name</i> and into
the <i>Nature</i> of Christ; as much difference as between
plunging the Body in Water and the Regeneration of the Soul; the
one is an outward visible sign of the other, which is the
Substance.&nbsp; That it is a command it is evident&mdash;<i>then
he commanded them to be baptized</i>.&nbsp; God sent John to
baptize, and Jesus sent his disciples.&nbsp; It is an act of
religious Worship, and it is intended to represent the
Sufferings, Death, Burial, and Resurrection of the Son of
God.&nbsp; It is intended to lead the mind to the Blood of Jesus
for its Pardon; and having this Pardon of Sin sealed home upon
the conscience, this is the answer of a good conscience towards
God; and this is the Work of Faith to apprehend and apply the
Death of Jesus to the conscience, through the operation of the
Holy Spirit.&mdash;I now come to the principal Ordinance I mean
to give my thoughts on, and in which, I believe, all who love the
Saviour agree&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Sixthly</i>&mdash;The <span class="smcap">Lord&rsquo;s
Supper</span>.&mdash;1st.&nbsp; I shall notice the Nature and
Design of it.&nbsp; 2ndly.&nbsp; Point out the Characters who
have a Right to partake of it.&nbsp; 3rdly.&nbsp; Answer some of
the Objections brought against such a partaking of it, by some of
those very Persons who have a Right to it; and in so doing I will
not encourage the Pharisee or the Libertine, <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>nor bolster
up an Hypocrite with false evidences, but descend to the lowest
class of God&rsquo;s People; none else have any Right, either to
Doctrines, Promises, Ordinances, or Evidences.&nbsp; Reader, all
the faults are mine, but the truths are God&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s Supper ought always to follow
Baptism&mdash;the one is preparatory to the other, and none but
those who submit to the one, ought to be admitted to the other;
at least this was the ancient custom among the first Christians,
who had light given them to see the Order and Design of them
both.&nbsp; This is called the Body and Blood of Christ, not
really so, but symbolically represented to our faith.&nbsp; Some
call it the Ordinance&mdash;so it is; but the term is not
emphatic enough&mdash;the Scriptures call it <i>the Communion of
the Body and Blood of Christ</i>, because the People of God held
communion with Christ and one another.&nbsp; It is called <i>this
Bread</i>, and <i>this Cup of the Lord</i>.&nbsp; Sometimes it is
expressed by the <i>Breaking of Bread</i>&mdash;a part for the
whole.&nbsp; It is called <i>the Lord&rsquo;s Table</i>&mdash;a
Table he has furnished, as an emblem of Christ.&nbsp; It is
called a <i>Feast</i>&mdash;<i>Let us keep the Feast</i>.&nbsp;
But the best phrase of all is the <i>Lord&rsquo;s
Supper</i>&mdash;a Supper, the last Ordinance the Lord
instituted, and at which he has promised his gracious
presence.&nbsp; It was instituted and first eaten at night; and
was first performed by our Lord the evening in which he was
betrayed; nor does this detract from the grandeur of <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the
entertainment; though it is of little consequence what part of
the day it is celebrated, yet I certainly give the preference to
the evening, as it is better calculated to remind us of that
evening when our dear Redeemer went out into the Garden of sad
Gethsamane; the night Judas betrayed him&mdash;the night
Christ&rsquo;s holy soul endured the wrath of God&mdash;the night
he sweat drops of blood&mdash;the night he struggled with, and
overcame the powers of Hell; &rsquo;twas on that dark, that
doleful night!&nbsp; Permit me here to observe, that this is the
best time, much better than an afternoon, when people and
ministers are generally dull in their frames.&nbsp; The divine
authority we have for keeping it is because it was instituted by
Christ himself.&nbsp; How dare Quakers and black Antinomians
ridicule this as a carnal Ordinance! it is a spiritual Feast,
made by a spiritual King, for a spiritual People, to be received
in a spiritual way.&nbsp; This is peculiar to the Gospel
Dispensation; perhaps typified in the Old Testament, by
Melchisedec, who was the Priest of the most high God, and brought
forth bread and wine to refresh Abraham and his weary troops; and
how many times has the same High Priest refreshed his dear people
in his Ordinances, particularly in the Supper-Scene?&nbsp;
Perhaps it was perpetually represented by Wisdom in the Proverbs,
saying to simple souls, called out of darkness into light,
<i>Come eat of my Bread and drink of the wine which I have
mingled</i>.&nbsp; And when we meet with Christ, and <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>enjoy his
presence in this Ordinance, we know what is meant by the
<i>mingled wine</i>.&nbsp; This Ordinance appears a more clear
command than any other, and it is to continue till Christ comes
the second time; and this second coming referred to, is in his
power and glory, at the last day.&nbsp; Some have attempted to
allegorize it, and they tell us we are not to keep this Ordinance
now, because Christ did come the second time on the Day of
Pentecost, and then all Figures and Shadows vanished.&nbsp; But
this objection is groundless; the Shadows of the Ceremonial Law
were abolished, but all figures are not done
away&mdash;<i>Baptism</i> is a Figure, and to be
observed&mdash;the <i>Lord&rsquo;s Supper</i> is a Figure of his
Body broken and his Blood shed, to take away Sin.&nbsp; And this
is plain by the Text, which was received by Paul long after the
Descent of the Holy Ghost on the Day of Pentecost&mdash;delivered
to him, and the Holy Spirit, by him, has commanded it to be kept
till the end of the world.&nbsp; The Matter of it First,
<i>Bread</i>, not wafer Cakes, which are not properly Bread, nor
broken, nor fit for nourishment, and so not a proper
emblem.&nbsp; <i>The Bread which we break</i>, <i>is it not the
Communion of the Body of Christ</i>?&mdash;not his mystical Body,
but an emblem of his natural Body, which he took into union with
his Godhead.&mdash;Secondly, <i>Wine</i>.&nbsp; This is another
part of the Ordinance; and the Matter of it a symbol of the Blood
of Christ&mdash;<i>This is my Blood</i>.&mdash;Paul says, <i>The
Cup of Blessing which we bless</i>, <i>is </i><a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span><i>it not the
Communion of the Blood of Christ</i>?&mdash;<i>The Blood of the
New Testament</i>.&nbsp; Every action of the Redeemer, in its
institution, is worthy of our highest regard.&nbsp; <i>He took
Bread</i>&mdash;this was to shew his act of taking our
flesh.&nbsp; <i>He blessed it</i>, that it might be nourishing to
our Faith, and encouraging to our Hope.&nbsp; <i>He brake
it</i>&mdash;to shew he should be broken for us.&nbsp; <i>He gave
it to his Disciples</i>&mdash;to shew he had given himself to his
People, for their eternal Salvation.&nbsp; The grand Design,
then, of this Ordinance appears to be, simply, to preach Christ
more clearly and sensibly&mdash;to bring him more to their
feelings or senses than hearing.&nbsp; <i>Faith cometh by
hearing</i>&mdash;but in this Ordinance we taste, touch, handle,
and have Christ evidently set forth as crucified, for our Faith
to apprehend.&nbsp; It is to remind us of his Love, in that
wonderful breaking forth of it, in his dreadful Sufferings, and
painful, though victorious Death.&nbsp; This is designed to
arrest our attention, and call forth our love, wonder,
admiration, and praise&mdash;to lead us to the contemplation of
his Agony and bloody Sweat&mdash;when in a cold night, such was
the agitation of his Soul, beneath the Wrath of God, the Guilt of
our Sin, and his Struggles with the Powers of Hell, that he
exclaimed <i>My Soul</i> (being truly human) <i>is exceeding
sorrowful</i>, <i>even unto death</i>.&nbsp; <i>O</i>! <i>my
Father</i>, <i>if it be possible</i>, <i>let this Cup pass from
me</i>.&nbsp; Here it was his great mind took in all the evil,
apprehended all the vileness that was in Sin.&nbsp; Our Sins here
beset <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>him,
stared him in the face; encompassed him, and he felt their burden
so heavy, he was filled with amazement and terror.&nbsp; <i>Now
it pleased the Father to bruise him</i>&mdash;he was exposed to
the whole storm of divine Wrath; he was in an Agony, such as had
never been felt before by any one&mdash;it covered his whole Body
with a bloody Sweat, which started from his Veins, came out at
the Pores, and fell in clots on the ground!&nbsp; The Curse due
to the Sins of the Elect, seized him and fell on him.&mdash;Here
it was he offered up <i>strong cries and tears to God</i>.&nbsp;
At this time his heart melted like wax, so that he might well
say, <i>I am poured out like water</i>.&nbsp; In the midst of
this Agony he was betrayed by an apostate Apostle, seized on by
an insulting rabble, led from the Garden, first to Annas, next to
Caiaphas, and then to Pilate; from him to Herod, then back again
to the Roman Governor.&nbsp; Here he endured the contradiction of
Sinners against himself&mdash;He stands at Pilate&rsquo;s
Bar&mdash;then uncovered, bound to a pillar, and flogged by
merciless men&mdash;a thousand Roman soldiers, perhaps, around
him, and each gave him a wound&mdash;being bound so fast to the
post, as that his arms were ready to break.&nbsp; Now the
Ploughers <i>ploughed on his Back</i>, <i>and made long
furrows</i>&mdash;he was wounded that his flesh was made black
and blue with blows&mdash;they continued their strokes till they
made him bare to the very bone&mdash;then he was untied and
turned, and tied up again, so as to wound that part which yet
remained whole&mdash;<a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>then platting a crown of thorns,
drove them into his Temples, so that they entered into his Skull,
so that the pain was exquisite&mdash;they put a reed or cane in
his hand, struck him with it&mdash;mocked his Offices&mdash;put
on his Body an old coat&mdash;they smote him with their
hands.&mdash;He came forth, wearing the purple robe and crown of
thorns.&nbsp; But, O! what an object of grief, sorrow, and
pain!&nbsp; He looks around him, and exclaims, <i>Beheld the
Man</i>! while his every step was marked with blood!&nbsp; The
rabble still cry out, <i>Away with him</i>!&nbsp; <i>Crucify
him</i>!&mdash;He goes forth, and ascends the Hill, where his
dear Body was nailed to the cursed tree.&nbsp; See him giving his
dear Hands, with all the meekness and patience of a Lamb, to the
cruel executioners, while they, hard as adamant, drove the rugged
iron through them.&nbsp; His Body was stretched on the cold
Cross, his Hands and Feet bored through with iron pins, from
which the Blood gushed out abundantly.&nbsp; Here was <i>a
fountain opened</i>, under the Wrath of God!&nbsp; The heavens
gathering a dismal gloom, he cried out, <i>My God</i>, <i>my
God</i>! <i>why hast thou forsaken me</i>?&mdash;All these
sorrows, and infinitely more than these, our Jesus experienced
for our Salvation.&nbsp; This is what is represented in the
Supper&mdash;and &ldquo;Hard is the wretch that never felt one
soft affection move;&rdquo; for, &ldquo;Did ere such love and
sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown?&rdquo;&nbsp; And
I must doubt the state of those who despise this Ordinance as
carnal, seeing it is the <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>last request of him who is God-Man
Mediator, our friend, and eternal <i>all</i>.</p>
<p>I now proceed, 2ndly, <i>To point out the Characters that are
incited</i>, for whom this was instituted, and <i>who have a
right to partake of this Ordinance</i>.&nbsp; Negatively&mdash;No
Unbeliever, no ignorant Persons, who know neither God nor
themselves; no immoral Character; no Pharisee, Worldling, or
Hypocrite&mdash;these, if they could be found out, ought to be
denied; but the <i>Tares and the Wheat</i> must grow together
till the <i>Harvest</i>&mdash;the wise and foolish Virgins will
keep on till the midnight Cry is made; the sacred Scriptures are
the grand touch-stone&mdash;all must be weighed in these Balances
of the Sanctuary; Doctrines, Experience, Ordinances, and
Characters, must be according to this Word.&nbsp; As all
Promises, so all Ordinances are for the People of God; and these
People go by various names in Scripture&mdash;perhaps the best is
that of Children.&nbsp; The most lovely character of God is that
of a Father, and the nearest idea of relationship is that of
Children: this term relates to the whole Election of Grace, among
Jews and Gentiles.&nbsp; God called the Israelites his Children,
and the same name is given to his chosen among the
Gentiles&mdash;<i>More are the Children of the Desolate than the
Children of the married Wife</i>, saith the Lord.&nbsp; As
Children, and by virtue of our adoption into his family, as the
fruit of eternal love, all the Ordinances of the <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Gospel are
ours&mdash;<i>all are yours</i>, <i>and ye are
Christ&rsquo;s</i>.&nbsp; As Children, he has provided a Table,
and he, as our Father, loves to see us at it&mdash;we have a
right to it; to this priviledge all the Children of God were
appointed&mdash;<i>having predestinated us to the adoption of
Children</i>; this was an eternal act.&nbsp; But I shall now
consider, Why they are so called, which will give us to see
whether we have any evidence in our souls that we are the
Children of God, and have the <i>Spirit of Adoption</i>, to say,
<i>Father</i>, <i>Father</i>.&nbsp; <i>Doubtless thou art our
Father</i>.&nbsp; If Children, then, in the <i>First</i> place,
<i>We must be born again</i>: this originates in his
will&mdash;<i>of his own will begat he us</i>.&nbsp; This New
Birth is the sovereign Act of God&mdash;<i>Born not of the will
of the flesh</i>, <i>but of God</i>.&nbsp; This Work is solely
through the Agency of God the Holy Spirit&mdash;<i>Except a man
be born of Water and the Spirit</i>, <i>he cannot see</i> (that
is to say, <i>enjoy</i>) <i>the kingdom of Heaven</i>.&nbsp; The
means he usually makes use of is the Word&mdash;<i>being
born</i>, <i>not of corruptible Seed</i>, <i>but the Word of
God</i>.&nbsp; Sometimes through the Ministry of Men&mdash;<i>My
little Children</i>, <i>for whom I travel in
Birth&mdash;Timothy</i>, <i>my own son in the Faith</i>.&nbsp;
This New Birth is produced by the inhabitation of the Spirit, he
forms this new Man at once; our knowledge of it is
progressive.&nbsp; This work on the heart consists.&nbsp; First,
in spiritual <i>Light</i> in the mind.&nbsp; By this we are led
to see our lost state by Nature, and the Suitableness of
Jesus.&nbsp; This, (as an evidence it is of God, in a covenant
way) is <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>always attended with humble confession, self-abhorrence,
seeking after Pardon in the Atonement of Christ; after a better
righteousness than our own, and a sense of God&rsquo;s favour;
and wherever this Work is begun, such souls cannot, will not rest
till they have found that <i>Pearl of greatest
price</i>&mdash;their eyes are open to see the value of it.&nbsp;
Secondly, <i>Life</i>&mdash;this distinguishes a Believer from an
Hypocrite, or a mere nominal Professor.&nbsp; This is God&rsquo;s
Blessing on Mount Zion; and it is felt by the most lively and
keen sensations of the Burden of Sin; of the Guilt, the Power,
and Love of it&mdash;this arms Death&mdash;this makes Judgment
and Eternity formidable.&nbsp; This Life is felt and discovered
in hungering and thirsting after Christ, as the Rest of his
Saints.&nbsp; This is to be seen and felt under the
Word&mdash;sometimes in reproving, directing, comforting,
instructing, and building up.&nbsp; This Life is felt when God
proclaims Liberty to the Soul; for as Life must be in the heart,
to feel Bondage, so we can always tell by the same in
Liberty.&mdash;This New Birth is attended with much pain, many
conflicts, and gloomy fears&mdash;in some Children of God they
are lighter than others, but all are taught by the same Spirit,
and the work is the same in all, in point of its
Nature.&mdash;The Third, is <i>Love</i>.&nbsp; This is infused
into the mind as a holy Principle, though it is not shed abroad
till it is felt, casting out fear, which hath
torment&mdash;<i>this is born of God</i>, <i>and sinneth
not</i>.&nbsp; When Light and Life come into the Soul, Love <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>always
attends it; and though it is but little exercised under the
Workings of Conviction, yet it is in the Heart&mdash;this is
evident, for let a Believer be under what Law-Work he may, he, at
times, feels a love to Truth and to Jesus, though he cannot see
his interest in him, yet he desires to love him above all.&nbsp;
He feels a love to Ministers of the Truth, though he is cut up
root and branch by them, yet he loves them.&nbsp; He loves the
Ordinances, and wishes he could see his right to them.&nbsp; He
loves the People of God, thinks they all excel him, and sometimes
is envious of their felicity; not that he would deprive them of
what they enjoy, but he is jealous lest God loves them and not
him.&nbsp; I might mention <i>Fear</i>, as it is a covenant
Blessing; but wherever there is Love, there is a holy,
child-like, filial Fear.&nbsp; These things evidence God is our
Father, Christ our Friend, and shew our Right to this and every
other Ordinance.&mdash;<i>Secondly</i>, by our <i>Food</i>; the
Holy Spirit having given us spiritual Appetites; and having
graciously provided spiritual Food for his Children, he has
<i>been</i> pleased to send his Ministers to proclaim it; and
setting before his People the Blessings of an everlasting
Covenant, in the everlasting Love of God, and made known in an
everlasting Gospel, by Ministers of his own sending.&nbsp;
<i>Christ</i>, in the Glories of his Person, in the Love of his
Heart, in his atoning Sacrifice, in his perfect Obedience, in his
Sufferings, victorious Death, Burial, Resurrection, and
Ascension, in his <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>covenant Engagements, and lovely Offices.&nbsp; This is
the Food of an immortal mind, and well calculated to satisfy
it.&nbsp; All the Promises of the Word, the Invitations, and
precious Declarations, are set forth as Food for his Children,
and we can feed upon nothing else.&nbsp; All the Doctrines of the
Gospel, and all the Perfections of God, as displayed in our
complete Salvation&mdash;if these things are precious to us, this
is another evidence that we are Children of God, and have a Right
to his Ordinances.&mdash;Thirdly, by our <i>Clothing</i>.&nbsp;
The Obedience of Christ to the Law, is a Robe, the best, or first
Robe, lined with Love, and hemmed round with every precious
Promise.&nbsp; This imputed to us by the Father, wrought out by
the Son, brought into the Conscience by the Spirit, and
apprehended by the hand of Faith, we are justified freely, by
this covenant Act of Grace.&nbsp; This we sweetly enjoy, when
<i>the Spirit bears witness to our spirits</i>&mdash;at all times
we depend on it, for our Righteousness before God.&nbsp;
<i>Humility</i> is another part of our cloathing, as
Children&mdash;<i>be ye clothed with Humility</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Zeal</i>.&mdash;This at times is put on; the Exercises of the
Graces of the Spirit, on their proper Objects, is called
Garments; and while God says, <i>Put on thy beautiful
Garments</i>, we can say, <i>I will greatly rejoice in the
Lord</i>, <i>for he hath clothed me with the Garments of his
Salvation</i>.&nbsp; This shews our Right to the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper.&nbsp; <i>Fourthly</i>, in our <i>Education</i>.&nbsp; God
the Spirit trains us up in the way we should go.&nbsp; Hence it
is written, <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span><i>They shall be all taught of God</i>.&nbsp; We sit
down at the feet of Christ, and learn the Emptiness of the
Creature; the Vanity of the World; the Danger of a Form of
Godliness without the Power; the dangerous Tendency of false
Doctrines; the Devices of the Devil; the Workings of the old Man;
the perpetual Warfare between the Flesh and the Spirit; the
Difference between the Law and the Gospel; a Minister of the
Spirit and one of the mere Letter; what it is to forget the
things that are behind, and to be pressing on to know, win, and
apprehend Christ as our Salvation, who first loved, choose, and
apprehended us.&nbsp; These are some of the many Lessons we learn
in his School&mdash;and who teacheth like him?&nbsp; We learn how
to walk by Faith, live by Faith; to make use of Christ, as the
whole Armour of God; and to rejoice in his eternal Love, and
immutable Covenant&mdash;and these evidence our Right to the
sacramental Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ.&mdash;I
might here mention the <i>Corrections</i> we
received&mdash;<i>for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth</i>,
<i>and scourgeth every Son he receiveth</i>.&nbsp; Mark that!
they are <i>Sons</i>.&nbsp; The kind Presents, the Love-Tokens,
the Deliverances, the Support, the Protection, Care, long
Suffering, Kindness, Compassion which our Father manifests to us,
in public and in private; the Letters he kindly accepts from us,
while we are out at School; the kind Answers he gives; the
Presents he sends; the Indulgences he grants; all evidence he is
our Father, <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>and we his Children.&mdash;I now appeal to my own Soul,
and to all who hear me, What know we of these Things?&nbsp;
Examine yourselves; let a Man examine by the Touchstone of
God&rsquo;s Word: if the above are Things you have felt and
known, in some degree, then you are welcome to the
Sacrament.&nbsp; Approach the Table, let nothing keep you
back&mdash;Obey his Commands, they are the Commands of a Father
to his Children; of a King to his Subjects; of a Master to his
Servants; of a Captain to his Soldiers; but, above all, the
Intreaty of a dying Friend to those he loves.&nbsp; This leads
me,</p>
<p>3rdly.&nbsp; <i>To answer some Objections</i>&mdash;there
really is no end to objecting.&nbsp; I principally intend to
answer the Objections of those who are Children of God, who
through weakness of Judgment, and Faith, and for want of clear
Evidences, scruple about their Right to the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper.&mdash;Here I scarcely know how to begin, the objections
are so numerous.&nbsp; I will answer the few following: Some
object, Because, say they, I am so very bad; I have such Evils in
my Nature; such Thoughts in my Heart; such Fears I shall never be
saved.&mdash;These Objections are frivolous; if you tarry till
you are better, you will never come; you cannot come too bad to
Jesus&mdash;<i>I will in no wise cast out</i>.&nbsp; You must
come to every Ordinance, and to Jesus, as a Sinner, vile and
polluted.&nbsp; Away then with that legal notion, that proud
spirit! for this Objection <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>arises from Pride: it is, in fact,
saying, If I was better than I am, I should have less need of
Jesus, and less need of his Grace.&nbsp; Besides, not any thing
you feel can justify you in the breach of a plain
Command.&mdash;<i>Do this in remembrance of me</i>.&nbsp; Another
objects to the Table, because it is not essential to Salvation;
then I wonder you do not object to hearing, to reading, to
praying&mdash;for none of these things are essential to
Salvation; and though it is not essential to your Salvation, you
may find it essential to the Knowledge and Enjoyment of it.&nbsp;
Here at the table, God has met with many.&nbsp; Besides this,
though not essential to Salvation itself, yet it is an essential
Command of the eternal Jehovah&mdash;<i>Do this</i>.&nbsp; Let
his Word be obeyed whether essential to Salvation of
not.&mdash;Another Objector says, I think it best to stay till I
know more of myself and of God, and then I will come.&nbsp; This
is acting against yourself, as well as the Command: if the
Ordinances are designed to communicate Knowledge to the Mind, and
you feel your need of Knowledge, you ought, above every other, to
be in the use of that Ordinance, to gain a clearer
Knowledge&mdash;<i>In the keeping thy Commands there is great
reward</i>.&nbsp; We cannot get our Knowledge first, and then
come to Ordinances; but in the Ordinances God may be pleased to
give you clearer Knowledge.&nbsp; But do you obey his
voice?&nbsp; <i>My Sheep hear</i> (<i>obey</i>) <i>my
voice</i>&mdash;<i>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh from
Heaven</i>&mdash;<i>Do this</i>, <i>in </i><a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span><i>remembrance of me</i>.&mdash;Another Objector says, I
think it right to wait till I see my interest clear.&nbsp; This
appears very feasible; but, upon examination, this Objection
falls to the ground.&nbsp; When our Lord instituted it and gave
it to his Disciples, they did not make this Objection, and say,
Oh, we cannot think of obeying your Commands, nor receiving the
Bread and Wine at your Hands; because you have not yet manifested
yourself clearly to us.&mdash;We read of no such Objection.&nbsp;
What Philip said to the Eunuch on another occasion, may be
applied to this&mdash;<i>If thou believest with all thine
heart</i>, <i>thou mayest</i>.&nbsp; If you believe on Jesus, in
such a way as to depend on him, look to him, and desire nothing
in comparison with him, your Faith is to grow exceedingly, even
up to full Assurance.&nbsp; By the use of Ordinances, then, in
order to see your Interest clearly, obey his divine Word, <i>Do
this</i>, and you shall be blessed, though not for, yet <i>in</i>
the deed,</p>
<blockquote><p>Let not Conscience make you linger,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor of Fitness fondly dream;<br />
All the fitness he requireth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is to feel your need of him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With respect to others, in reference to Church Orders, this
must be left to the Consciences of Believers, whether they are
led to approve of strict or mixt Communions; as there are
Ministers who are faithful and experimental, of both
Parties.&mdash;I must pass by many other Objections I have heard,
as <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>scarcely worth attending to.&nbsp; I close, with
answering the old Objection, which arises from the
Apostle&rsquo;s language, <i>He that eateth and drinketh
unworthily</i>, <i>eateth and drinketh his own damnation</i>,
<i>not discerning the Lord&rsquo;s Body</i>.&nbsp; This has
frightened many, and kept them, through their own legality, from
the Table.&nbsp; As to Worthiness, we shall never possess it; we
may as well object to every meal, to the light of the sun, to
every breath we draw, as object to the Table because of our
Unworthiness.&nbsp; To set this Passage in a fair light, it
appears there was a custom in the Corinthian Church, of having a
Supper before the Sacrament: this was, as they said, to imitate
Christ, who, with his Disciples, first kept the Passover Feast,
then celebrated his own Supper.&nbsp; At this Anti-Feast or
Supper, they acted so disorderly, exceeding the bounds of
Temperance and Sobriety, that in the midst of such Cheerfulness
and Gaiety, they were not fit to attend to the Lord&rsquo;s
Supper.&mdash;<i>See ver.</i> 20, 21.&mdash;All are worthy whom
he invites, his Friends, his Beloved, his Children, because they
in the Supper discern the Lord&rsquo;s Body; but all others, who
have no Knowledge of Christ, nor the Nature of the ordinance, are
considered as unworthy, or unfit persons; and when this Ordinance
is dishonored by such Characters, they dishonor the Saviour it
holds forth, and eat and drink, not eternal <i>damnation</i>, but
<i>condemnation</i> to themselves; God testifying his
disapprobation of the Abuse of any of his <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>Ordinances&mdash;this he did in the Corinthian Church,
(<i>see ver.</i> 30) the Lord chastened them who had behaved in
such a disorderly manner, with bodily infirmity; and although he
saved their Souls in himself, yet he actually took away some by
Death.&nbsp; The Unworthiness then spoken of in this Text, is not
of the Persons, but of the unbecoming conduct of those who would
come in a state of Intoxication or Gluttony, to the Lord&rsquo;s
Table; and the Damnation spoken of, is Guilt, and of course, the
sad consequences attending it; so that this Objection to the
Lord&rsquo;s Table must fail&mdash;only let a Man examine
himself, whether he is a Child of God&mdash;whether he is in the
Faith and the Faith in him&mdash;a Faith, that works by
Love&mdash;goes out of self and embraces Christ as his Atonement,
Righteousness, and Strength&mdash;that produces good Works, and
animates the Mind in the Prospect of that Joy which never fades
away.</p>
<blockquote><p>JESUS, thy Feast we celebrate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We shew thy Death, we sing thy Name,<br />
Till thou return, and we shall eat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Marriage Supper of the Lamb.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
